## Contributors
 
Contributors interact with the project on GitHub by filing new issues, improving existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Anyone can become a contributor: there is no expectation of commitment to the project, no required set of skills, and no selection process. The only obligation is to follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
Specific advice for contributing to the project can be found in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/daya6489/DriveML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
 
## Core developers
 
Core developers are collectively responsible for day-to-day development of the package, including responding to issues and reviewing pull requests. They are GitHub administrators and [package authors](https://github.com/daya6489/DriveML/blob/master/DESCRIPTION), which means that they have the ability to make changes to project code, and receive credit when others cite the package.
 
While core developers can modify code directly, this ability is rarely used. Instead, changes are proposed as pull requests, and are only merged after they have been reviewed by at least one other core developer. Changes to the API (especially breaking changes) must also be approved by the project lead. 
 
 
The core developers of DriveML are:
 
* [Sayan Putatunda]( https://github.com/sayanddude )
* [Kiran R](https://github.com/rkirana)
* [Ravi Kondapalli](https://github.com/rpkon)
 
All core developers are bound by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
## Project lead
 
The project lead, [Dayananda Ubrangala](https://github.com/daya6489), is responsible for:
 
* Setting, and clearly communication the strategic objectives of the project.
* Mediating any conflicts amongst the core developers.
* Ensuring that the project survives in the long term.
 
The project lead is bound by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
# Decision-making process
 
This project makes decisions according to a consensus model where suggestions are considered and discussed between the community and core developers, typically in GitHub issues. Where consensus cannot be reached, the project lead's word is final. If the community questions a decision, the project lead may review it and either uphold or reverse it.
